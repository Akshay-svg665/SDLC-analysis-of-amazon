# SDLC-analysis-of-amazon
This repository contains all the diagrams and information related to the analysis.
Founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, Amazon has transformed from a modest online bookstore into one of the preeminent e-commerce and technology enterprises globally. The platform caters to millions of customers across the globe, delivering a diverse array of products and services, including cloud computing (AWS), logistics, and entertainment (Prime Video), among others. This intricate system necessitates a strong and adaptable software development lifecycle (SDLC) model to accommodate continuously evolving business requirements, technological innovations, and high user demands.
The SDLC denotes the methodology through which software is conceived, executed, and maintained. It encompasses phases such as requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance. Various process models can be employed to manage the SDLC, each possessing its own advantages and drawbacks. This report will analyze three widely-used SDLC models—Incremental Development, Spiral Model, and Waterfall Model—emphasizing their appropriateness for Amazon's platform based on:
Functional and non-functional requirements.
Risk and change management.
Time and cost constraints.
Furthermore, a simplified requirements document for Amazon’s system will be developed, followed by a strategy for validating these requirements and identifying potential challenges.
